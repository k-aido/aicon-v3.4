# Creator Search Feature

This document describes the implementation of the Instagram creator search feature in AICON v3.4.

## Overview

The creator search feature allows users to search for Instagram creators, view their content, and add content pieces to their canvas for analysis.

## Components

### 1. Database Schema
- **creator_searches**: Tracks user search requests and Apify run status
- **creators**: Master table for creator profiles across platforms  
- **creator_content**: Scraped content with 30-day caching
- **processing_queue**: Background task queue for async operations

### 2. API Routes

#### `/api/creators/search` (POST)
- Validates Instagram handles/URLs
- Checks cache for existing content
- Creates Apify scraping runs if needed
- Returns immediate response with searchId

#### `/api/apify/webhook` (POST)  
- Processes Apify completion callbacks
- Stores scraped content and creator profiles
- Updates search status to completed/failed

#### `/api/creators/status` (GET)
- Polls search status by searchId
- Returns progress and sample results

### 3. UI Components

#### `CreatorSearchPanel.tsx`
- Sliding panel from right side
- Platform selector (Instagram active, others coming soon)
- Search input with validation
- Filter dropdown (Top Likes, Comments, Views, Most Recent)
- Results grid with content cards
- Loading states and error handling
- "Add to Canvas" functionality

#### Updated `CanvasSidebar.tsx`
- Added UserSearch icon button
- Green color (#10B981) for creator search
- Positioned between AI Chat and Instagram
- Tooltip shows "Search Creators"

## Integration Flow

1. User clicks Creator Search button in toolbar
2. CreatorSearchPanel slides in from right
3. User enters Instagram handle (@alexhormozi for testing)
4. System validates input and checks cache
5. If no cache, starts Apify Instagram Scraper
6. User gets immediate searchId response
7. Frontend polls status every 2 seconds
8. Apify webhook processes results when complete
9. Content cards display with engagement metrics
10. User clicks "+" to add content to canvas
